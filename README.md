# Project Name -Olympic road to gold

# Project objective
from historical data of Olympic, the objetive of this project is to answer:
1. How has the performance of athletes changed based on gender, and has this led to a reduction in the performance gap?
2. Can past Olympic results reliably predict future outcomes?

## Hypothesis

1. As women have increasingly participated in the Olympic Games and gained more equal opportunities to train and compete, the performance gap should have diminished over the last century. It is expected to continue decreasing in every competition.
2. As the Olympic program and cultural involvement are factors that influence the competitiveness of athletes in the Olympics, past results can be used to predict future outcomes

# Project Description

To answer the questions, we used a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephcheng123456/olympic-historical-dataset-from-olympediaorg?rvi=1) and scraped the Olympic Games website for results.

# Conclusion
1. How has the performance of athletes changed based on gender, and has this led to a reduction in the performance gap?

  - the performance gap due to gender becomes smaller among top-performing athletes on specific sports.  
  - The reported 10% performance gap has been reducing.

2. Can past Olympic results reliably predict future outcomes?

- There is insufficient evidence to predict future outcomes based on past results. However, it does increase the probability of predicting the result.
